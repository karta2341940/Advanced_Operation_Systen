\question 
First, write a simple program called null.c that creates a pointer
to an integer, sets it to NULL, and then tries to dereference it.
Compile this into an executable called null. What happens when you
run this program?

\begin{solution}
Please refer to List 1 (null.c):

\lstinputlisting[label=code-null.c, caption=null.c]{../null.c}

Its execution results are as follows:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
Start
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
\end{lstlisting}

As we can see the program is terminated with a segmentation fault.

So we know that if a variable doesn't allocated memory space,
it will cause a segmentation fault when it is dereferenced.

But if we need to reference it.
It's ok to reference it.
\end{solution}



\end{questions}

\question 
Next, compile this program with symbol information included (with
the -g flag). Doing so let’s put more information into the executable,
enabling the debugger to access more useful information about variable 
names and the like. Run the program under the debugger by typing gdb null 
and then, once gdb is running, typing run. What does gdb show you?

\begin{solution}
    
Its execution results are as follows:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
(gdb) run
Starting program: /home/it/Desktop/Advanced_Operation_Systen/hw3/null 
[Thread debugging using libthread_db enabled]
Using host libthread_db library "/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libthread_db.so.1".
Start
The address of p is (nil)

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0x00005555555551ab in main () at null.c:16
16          printf("The value of p is %d\n", *p);
\end{lstlisting}
The gdb shows that the program is terminated with a segmentation fault.

\end{solution}
\end{questions}

\question 
Finally, use the valgrind tool on this program. We’ll use the memcheck
tool that is a part of valgrind to analyze what happens. Run
this by typing in the following: valgrind --leak-check=yes
null. What happens when you run this? Can you interpret the
output from the tool?
\begin{solution}

\end{lstlisting}
When I run 'null' with valgrind, it shows that it can't 
read the memory that it's size is 4.

Address 0x0 is not stack'd, malloc'd or (recently) free'd means that
the address 0x0 is not allocated and recently freed. Also the program 
is terminated with a SIGSEGV signal which means a process executes a 
invalid memory reference.

And we can see at line 23 shows that the program has a memory block in use at exit.

    \question 
    Write a simple program that allocates memory using malloc() but
    forgets to free it before exiting. What happens when this program
    runs? Can you use gdb to find any problems with it? How about
    valgrind (again with the --leak-check=yes flag)?

    
    \begin{solution}
    Please refer to List 1 (q4.c):
    
    \lstinputlisting[label=code-q4.c, caption=q4.c]{../q4.c}
    
    Its execution results are as follows:
    \begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
Start
The address of p is 0x55f62934c2a0
The value of p is 0
End
    \end{lstlisting}

    The result use gdb is as follows:
    \begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
(gdb) run

    1. What happens when this program runs?
    
    Ans : The program executes normally seems not big deal.

    
    2. Can you use gdb to find any problems with it?
    
    Ans : No, gdb shows the program is terminated normally.
    
    
    3. How about valgrind (again with the --leak-check=yes flag)?
    
    Ans : Yes, valgrind shows that the program has a memory leak.

    1. What happens?
    
    Ans : The program is terminated with a SIGABRT signal which means 
    a process aborts.

    2. Do you need tools to find this type of problem?

    Ans : Yes ,I use valgrind to find this type of problem.
    We can see the output of valgrind that we do a invalid free() operation.
    It seems we can't free a memory block that in the 
    middle of a series of memory that allocated.
